# My Sandbox Project

## Objective/Purpose/Whathaveyou

This project is really just to experiment a bit in the MERN stack. I started out by just throwing together a quick CRA and building out some basic components. Since I've been meaning to get around to building something with React Hooks and Google Maps, I figured this would be a good place to try that as well.

So I don't necessarily have any grand plans for this codebase, however, I won't stop it from evolving into something useful if that ends up happening, either!!
